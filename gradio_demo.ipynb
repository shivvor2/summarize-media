    " video for a minute apparently it's about hagmaxing i know nothing about it um again i'm old so i've learned new terms almost every single fucking day every single fucking day so this should be a good one social and economic factors and the rich evil let me know if you can hear this i think it should be good government the american dream of owning a house and having a wife and two kids is dying and the zoomer coomer fantasy of a rich older girlfriend taking charge and making you chicken nuggies while you play video games in your pajamas all day is\n",

    " I just want to just comment on that really fast. I probably brought this up a couple of times because I'm a broken record. But as you guys know, I used to be married before and, you know, kids and everything. So it's funny because now that I'm out of it, I think to myself, like, do I still want stuff like that? And hearing that alone, I'm just like, hmm, it seems like the whole culture nowadays is kind of like pushing away from that. I don't know how I feel about that. You know, I have like mixed feelings. I have mixed feelings.\n",
    "Start: 00:00:58 - End: 00:01:28\n",
    " But the whole thing about older people. Okay. So at least from my understanding, hag maxing is young folk wanting to date older people. That's my understanding. I'm sure she'll tell me. But chat, you're going to have to explain some of this for me because you know me. I don't. I have no idea. I have no idea. Thriving. Back in my day, we called this cougar hunting. Same. Same. Mommy issues. Also same. Still have those.\n",
    "Start: 00:01:28 - End: 00:01:57\n",
    " The kids today are calling it something different, hag maxing. I have been told, also I think this might be just a tad bit too loud. I have been told that there is a lot of things now where it's maxing. Everything's like maxing, hag maxing, game maxing, or not game maxing, game, game. Apparently there's a few things. Apparently there's a fucking few things. I'm not exactly sure if that's like actually a thing or not, but chat, I'm sure you guys can explain all that to me. Actually, you know, before I continue,\n",
    "Start: 00:01:57 - End: 00:02:24\n",
    " Is that just like a thing now? It's just like everything is maxing. Who made that? How long has this been a thing? I gotta know. Cause apparently I'm missing out on a few things. Apparently I'm missing out on like a few things. I'm assuming this is semi-recent cause I'm just barely hearing all this. It's heavy maxing. Thank you. Thank you. Um, I think the very first time that I heard any of this shit was probably in February when it was my birthday. Um, we just hit 31.\n",
    "Start: 00:02:25 - End: 00:02:53\n",
    " And a couple of people came in. I think someone rated into me. They're like, oh my God, you're 31. You're finally a hag. You're finally like hag maxing. I never even asked what the fuck that meant. I had no idea what the fuck that meant. So I just rolled with it. I just rolled with it. Because when I think of hag, I think of a witch, which by the way, it is October. So I was like, oh, perfect timing. Perfect timing. But apparently it is not that. Then again, I could go as a witch this year for Halloween, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.\n",
    "Start: 00:02:54 - End: 00:03:23\n",
    " In my last video, I jokingly referenced the term hag-maxing. You've been on a date with a 40-year-old? Okay, that's different. How is that different? He's right. Remember how I said that I will only watch two videos with her? That was the first one. That was the first one. I think I might have watched that with Asmin when he was reacting. I think that's the one. Really good video. I think that was about dating, especially nowadays. So, yeah. Things have been changing a lot in the dating sphere.\n",
    "Start: 00:03:23 - End: 00:03:52\n",
    " Now, I haven't been on a date or done all that shit in the years, which really I don't want to. But every time I see more and more of this shit, I'm just like, oh, maybe I just stay away. Maybe I just stay away. It's different. You're robbing the cradle. He's hag maxing. Educate yourself. Which greatly intrigued 37. Wait, chat, you know, I gotta ask you, what is the age? What is the age that everyone's like, oh, this is when it actually starts. I was told that it's after 30. That's what I was told.\n",
    "Start: 00:03:54 - End: 00:04:23\n",
    " Oh wait, so it's 30, 18. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You're just barely getting out of the cradle. 30, 30, 30. Okay. I thought it was after 30. Well, must've just already been like that. You know, actually another thing is, and I'm sure she'll say it, but I have noticed an extreme want for older women as of late. You know, last I checked, last I checked in like the real world, um, that wasn't really a thing. Must just be like an internet thing. Must be, must be.\n",
    "Start: 00:04:24 - End: 00:04:54\n",
    " A lot of you. So I decided, you know what? I am going to make an entire video dedicated to covering this phenomenon. Gen Z men going out of their way to date older women. Chat, is that any of you? Actually, you know what? Actually, I don't want to know. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. What is this? Nevermind. Nevermind. Nevermind. Nevermind. Is this happening? And if it's happening, is it a good thing or is it a symptom of broader societal issues? Why are all these young whippersnappers scooping up these older time pieces?\n",
    "Start: 00:04:55 - End: 00:05:21\n",
    " Oh, speaking of time pieces. Before she continues with that, I can tell you why the opposite. I can tell you why the opposite. With my ex-wife, she was older than me by six years. It is a couple of things. One, it's definitely a sex thing. I will say that. I will say that. Another thing is more just being with someone with more energy.\n",
    "Start: 00:05:21 - End: 00:05:45\n",
    " Um, sometimes when someone's older, like guys, girls, doesn't really matter. Um, a lot of the times, a lot of the times, um, you'll start drifting. Someone may have energy. Someone may not, um, in a normal guy, girl relationship. I was with girl, girl, but of course, but like for me, like that was a little different, but from what I've heard from normal relationships, um, I think, um,\n",
    "Start: 00:05:45 - End: 00:06:13\n",
    " So women tend to get in their prime more in their 30s. You know, that's when you really get inside their prime. That's when you get a little bit, that's when you get a little rugged. Now guys start to slowly slim away from it all. Like kind of, what is it? Your libido or something. I forget. I forget. Don't mind me. I just barely woke up. So bear with me. But point I'm trying to make is that the sex drive and everything starts to slowly slim while women's actually increase. It's about in their 30s. So sometimes you won't see eye to eye with things.\n",
    "Start: 00:06:14 - End: 00:06:39\n",
    " That's why. And again, I don't want to, I don't want to scare nobody, but that's why you'll see a lot of people either like they'll have affairs or anything else, usually in their thirties. Not sure if you ever noticed that, but tends to happen. Not everyone clearly, clearly, but there's a lot of issues that tend to happen during that time. Plus like a lot of times marriages have been there for a few years already. So you'll have a lot of differences. Then eventually just\n",
    "Start: 00:06:39 - End: 00:07:08\n",
    " That's what I've seen. That's usually what I've seen. Now, hopefully it doesn't happen to anyone here that's actually married. But that's what I've noticed from my scientific calculations. Hopefully I'm wrong with that, but that's what I've seen. Oh, it's right inside of an ad. Is anyone actually... Who actually still has watches? I used to. I used to have... What is it? G-Shocks.\n",
    "Start: 00:07:09 - End: 00:07:38\n",
    " I used to have G-Shocks back when I was active duty because here's the thing. They never broke. You can just jump in the water. You can do all that. You can smash it. It didn't really matter. It was just good. Yeah. But who still has watches? Anyone actually use them still? I just feel like watches are like something from the past. I had to take mine off for work. I know G-Shocks were great and they really weren't all that much. They really weren't all that much. I just would have it because like, listen, being an engineer, you tend to get your, um,\n",
    "Start: 00:07:39 - End: 00:08:07\n",
    " you will definitely get your hands dirty. And also you just smash things, smash things like with your hands on accident. So it's nice to have something where it's not going to break. So that was always nice for me. Yeah. And here's the thing. I liked watches because I didn't have to pull out my phone. Like it was just that simple, especially if you're in like a crawl space or whatever, whatever. So really depends on the situation. I prefer to use my phone, but usually I pull out my phone when I don't need it. And it just, it would just break. I can't tell you how many times I broke a phone.\n",

All the data basically says that women prefer to date men slightly older than them or around the same age as them. And men tend to date women younger than them or around the same age as them. Large age gaps, for the most part, are rare. In relationships where the man is older, he's usually only older by one to two years. In relationships where the woman is older, two to three years.

Please don't do that if you have kids.
